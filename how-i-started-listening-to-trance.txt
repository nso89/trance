In Grade 8, rap was the dominate genre at my school. Eminem’s Lose Yourself and 50 Cent’s
In the Club were constantly on the radio and the #1 video on countdown shows (YouTube was
still in it’s infancy).  If  you  didn’t listen to rap, you were the outcast, and you can
imagine the derogatory names other people would call you.

I would listen to rap just to fit in, but didn’t really like it.   I can only listen to a
rapper talk about  drugs,  feuding,  money,  and violence  so many times before it became
repetitive.  Sure,  you  can  make  the argument that trance songs are all about love and
positivity,  but  I  haven’t  found a trance song (and I don’t think I ever will), that’s
about the aforementioned topics.  I  can go to YouTube and watch a three part documentary
about rap feuds, and when you get older, you realize all these feuds were nonsense.   The
biggest  feud  at  the  time was 50 Cent and Ja Rule. Both rappers have different stories
about how it started, and it’s still going on today because of social media.

I would listen to a radio station that would play Euro and trance music, and say what you
want about him,  but Tiesto was my entrance into trance (Traffic, Lethal Industry, Adagio
for Strings, etc).  I remember when portable CD players were still available (MP3 players
and smart phones didn’t exist yet), I would burn CDs full of trance music.

By the time I was Grade 11,  I  didn’t  care  who  knew I listed to trance, and what they
called me (still don’t). I’m now in my 30s, and still loving trance!
